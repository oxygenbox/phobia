While many of us remember this polish-smelling mistake fixer to spell white with an “h,” it’s actually spelled “Wite-Out.” Convinced yet?

Guess what, the brand doesn’t actually have the word “of” in their name. Yes, that’s right: They’re just “Cup Noodles”

I received one of these myself as a Christmas present, and I distinctly remember it being spelled with an “x.” But really it’s spelled “Rubik’s.”

Is actually just Smokey Bear. You can still find photos and memorabilia on the internet with “Smokey the Bear,” but the official name of this forest fire-fighting bear is just “Smokey Bear”

E.T. didn’t actually say that famous line in the movie “E.T.” The direct quote is: “E.T. home phone.” In the defense of everyone who remembers it differently, Gertie immediately says “E.T. phone home” after the alien’s famous line.

Did this curious little monkey have a tail? While many remember otherwise, Curious George doesn’t have a tail. This also completely goes against basic monkey anatomy.

Does not end with “of the world,” like many remember it ending. The song just ends with the line “We are the champions,”

Who’s the fairest of them all? If you remember it like that, it’s not you. The evil queen in “Snow White” actually says: “Magic mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?”


Apparently, it’s not a beautiful day in the neighborhood — it’s a beautiful day is this neighborhood, though. Watch it here.

Is actually Froot Loops. Not Fruit Loops.


This wasn’t actually the famous line originally said in “Forrest Gump.” While everyone remembers it (and quotes it) as “Life is like a box of chocolates,” the movie actually says “Life was like a box of chocolates.” 

Many people remember the famous Pokemon to have a black stripe on the end of it’s tail. But apparently the stripe never existed.

"No, I am your father."
"Luke, I am your father."

"We're gonna need a bigger boat."
"You're gonna need a bigger boat."


"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."
"Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore."

"If you build it, they will come."
"If you build it, he will come."
